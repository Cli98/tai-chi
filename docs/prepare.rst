Prepare and Installation
========================

Prepare Environment
--------------------
Usually the `anaconda3 <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_ environment is good enough with python >= 3.6.

Then set up a jupyter service. Most of the interactive happens within jupyter.

Install Tai-Chi Engine
----------------------
You can simply do::

    pip install tai-chi-engine

If this is not happening, try install the package from source::

    pip install git+https://github.com/tcengine/tai-chi.git
